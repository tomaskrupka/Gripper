# Gripper

Gripper is a web scraping toolbox.

It launches a web browser and uses the [chrome devtools protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/) (CDP) to operate it.
Gripper is configurable to use either [Selenium](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ)
or [chrome-dev-tools-runtime](https://github.com/BaristaLabs/chrome-dev-tools-runtime) as the CDP client.


## Interface

The CDP has a rich interface and countless use cases. The WSS reduces its depth and width greatly with a solely web-scraping-focused facade.
