# About Gripper

about gripper, about automation, features, quickstart, principles.

Gripper is `.NET` toolbox for creating powerful browser automation agents.
Gripper operates in a browser window under its control, using the Chrome Devtools Protocol (CDP).
Gripper provides a full, type-safe access to the CDP and a set of own features built on top.

# Automating the Browser with Gripper

Prior to creating a browser automation agent, the target must be manually reverse-engineered, resulting in some kind of a  proof-of-concept prototype. The next step is turning the prototype into a reliable agent.

That is where Gripper fits into the workflow.

## Reducing Routines to CDP

While the prototype routine may contain manual steps, the agent must be fully automated. Furthermore, every step that involves browser interaction must be expressed in terms of CDP commands.

Gripper enables the implementation of any simple CDP command sequence by providing a full, type-safe access to the CDP endpoint of the hooked browser.

For more complex tasks, Gripper provides own APIs:

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Intercepting HTTP, WebSocket traffic | Subscribe to [`WebClientEvent`](api/Gripper_WebClient_IWebClient_WebClientEvent)s. No missed events as targets are [automatically attached](features#target-discovery-and-attachment). |
| Emulating inputs | The [`IElement`](api/Gripper_WebClient_IElement) interface automatically handles focusing and presents a unified abstraction for mouse and keyboard actions. |
| JS Evaluation: CORS | Gripper [tracks](features#browsing-context-to-execution-context-mapping) the execution contexts of iFrames. The [`IContext`](api/Gripper_WebClient_IContext) interface then abstracts script evaluation in an iFrame, complying with the rule that the DOM can only be touched from its own Execution Context. |
| JS Evaluation: CSRF | Thanks to the [`IContext`](api/Gripper_WebClient_IContext) interface, any iFrame can be used to evaluate a Fetch request against its origin, within the browser CSRF policy. |

## Deployment

A proof-of-concept prototype can't reveal issues related to long-running remote deployment.

For issues unique to the specific agent-deployment combination, Gripper enables implementing custom solutions by [passing ownership](#transparency) of its resources.
For common painpoints, Gripper is equipped with services that either solve the problem or provide useful tooling.

| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Authorized session timeout | |
| Crash or restart | |
| Automatic browser update | |
| Horizontal scaling | |
| Memory leaks | |


## Handling Edge Cases


| Problem | Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| Timed-out iFrames/Elements | |
| Responsive resizing | |
| Unexpected overlays/popups | |


# Principles

## Transparency

Gripper aims to be a zero-opacity layer.

Gripper passes ownership to the user by exposing the resources it creates or binds. This includes the browser OS `Process` handle, the root `ChromeSession` instance or full raw access to the browser CDP API endpoint.

The rule of thumb is that it should be possible to build Gripper on top of itself.

## Low Level Access

Compared to other popular automation frameworks, Gripper makes the CDP layer completely visible and accessible rather than masking its presence behind own adapters.

While Gripper does wrap the CDP with own code, the types, commands and events are always a 1-1 mapping. In fact, they're autogenerated from the [specs](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol/tree/master/json).

## Easy to keep up-to-date

The main [`Gripper.WebClient`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gripper.WebClient/) package depends on [`Gripper.ChromeDevTools`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gripper.ChromeDevTools/) for the CDP wrapper. Both packages are being kept up-to-date with the latest CDP API.

Furthermore, the `Gripper.ChromeDevTools` library can be [autogenerated](https://github.com/tomaskrupka/chrome-dev-tools-generator) against any version of the CDP API (defaults to [latest tip-of-tree](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol/tree/master/json)).

This means that creating updated Gripper builds as the protocol evolves can be fully automated.
