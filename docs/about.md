# About Gripper

Gripper is .NET toolbox for creating powerful browser automation agents.
Gripper operates in a browser window under its control, using the Chrome Devtools Protocol (CDP).
Gripper provides a full, type-safe access to the CDP and a set of own features built on top.

## Use Cases for Browser Automation

In any of the following (and many more) use cases, when the target does not offer a sufficient API, browser automation is the go-to solution:

- Booking a ticket before other bots book them out.
- Replying to an online post programmatically.
- Placing a bet on a live sports-betting site.
- Placing an order on an exchange.
- Timing a bid in an online auction.
- Aggregating a live stream into a dataset.
- Integration testing.

# Gripper Workflow

How does Gripper fit into the workflow of creating a browser automation agent?

In general, the process consists of two parts:

1. Reverse engineering the target, creating a prototype. This is a manual chore.
2. Turning the prototype into a reliable agent. This is what Gripper is for.

## Reverse Engineering the Target

This is an exploratory stage aiming to figure out a proof-of-concept routine.

Any tools can be used, but it has to be possible to reliably automate the used techniques later. For instance, hand-picking tokens from WebSocket messages to see if they work is fine, the polished agent can intercept WebSocket messages programmatically.

Exploring and rapidly iterating on dead-ends is key. Therefore, this is manual work with little automation potential and Gripper can't be used to speed up the process.

## Building the Agent with Gripper

Gripper is designed to handle challenges that come with turning a prototype into a reliable agent:

1. Implementing all browser automation routines using the CDP.
   -  Intercepting HTTP traffic and WebSockets.
   -  Emulating inputs.
   -  Evaluating custom JavaScript in proper context.
   -  Triggering custom Fetch requests.
   -  Accessing the DOM.
2. Handling edge-cases.
   -  Responsive resizing.
   -  Failed-to-load iFrames/elements.
   -  Unexpected overlays and popups ([Newsletter, anyone?](https://how-i-experience-web-today.com/))
3. Handling issues related to long-running remote deployment.
   -  Sustaining an active authorized session indefinitely.
   -  Cleaning up dead browser instances.
   -  Automatic browser updates.
   -  Horizontal scaling of demanding data-mining operations.

Gripper greatly simplifies meeting these objectives by offering well-tested, predictable low-level routines.

When Gripper does not offer a feature for a task, its built-in CDP wrapper offers a type-safe way to perform any task manually.

# Principles

## Transparency

Gripper exposes its resources, effectively passing ownership to the user. This includes the browser OS `Process` handle, the root `ChromeSession` instance or full raw access to the browser CDP API endpoint.

The rule of thumb is that it should be possible to build Gripper on top of itself without too much hacking.

## Low Level Access

Compared to other popular automation frameworks, Gripper makes the CDP layer completely visible and accessible rather than masking its presence behind own adapters.

While Gripper does wrap the CDP with own code, the types, commands and events are always a 1-1 mapping. In fact, they're autogenerated from the [specs](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol/tree/master/json).

## Easy to keep up-to-date

The main [Gripper.WebClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gripper.WebClient/) package depends on [Gripper.ChromeDevTools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gripper.ChromeDevTools/) for the CDP wrapper. Both packages are being kept up-to-date with the latest CDP API.

Furthermore, the `Gripper.ChromeDevTools` library can be [autogenerated](https://github.com/tomaskrupka/chrome-dev-tools-generator) against any version of the CDP API (defaults to [latest tip-of-tree](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/devtools-protocol/tree/master/json)).

This means that creating updated Gripper builds as the protocol evolves can be fully automated.
