The public interface of Gripper is separated from the standard implementation. 
Both are packed within the [Gripper.WebClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gripper.WebClient/) package.

The documentation is included in the source code files of the interfaces.

The linked website autogenerated by [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) provides an easy-to-read way to explore the API.
