The public interface of Gripper is separated from the standard implementation. 
Both are included in the [Gripper.WebClient](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Gripper.WebClient/) package.

The API documentation is included directly in the source code files of the interfaces.

Alternatively, a website is autogenerated at every build with [Doraku/DefaultDocumentation](https://github.com/Doraku/DefaultDocumentation), providing an easy-to-read way to explore the API:
